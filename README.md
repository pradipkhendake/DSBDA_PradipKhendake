   Matplotlib is a Python library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations like line plots, bar charts, etc.

5. **Difference between seaborn and matplotlib:**
   Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn provides prettier and more informative statistical graphics with less code.

6. **Is Sklearn and Scikit-learn the same?**
   Yes, `sklearn` is the import name for the `Scikit-learn` library. It's used for machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and clustering.

7. **Functions in Pandas and NumPy:**

   * Pandas: `read_csv()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `describe()`, `dropna()`, `fillna()`
   * NumPy: `array()`, `mean()`, `std()`, `reshape()`, `arange()`, `linspace()`

8. **What is DataFrame in Python?**
   A DataFrame is a 2D labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in Excel or SQL.

9. **How to find duplicates in Python?**

   ```python
   df.duplicated()
   ```

10. **Use of `describe()` command:**
    It gives summary statistics like count, mean, std, min, max, and percentiles for numerical columns.

### ü§ñ **Machine Learning & Evaluation Metrics**

11. **Naive Bayes classification algorithms in Python:**

    * GaussianNB
    * MultinomialNB
    * BernoulliNB (all in scikit-learn)

12. **Significance of Confusion Matrix:**
    It shows the performance of a classification model using TP, TN, FP, FN values.

13. **TP, TN, FP, FN in confusion matrix:**

    * TP: True Positive
    * TN: True Negative
    * FP: False Positive
    * FN: False Negative

14. **What is Recall?**
    Recall = TP / (TP + FN) ‚Äî It tells how many actual positives were correctly identified.

15. **What is Precision?**
    Precision = TP / (TP + FP) ‚Äî It tells how many predicted positives were actually correct.

16. **What is F1 Score?**
    F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It balances both.

17. **Need of Data Visualization in Data Science:**
    It helps to understand data easily, find patterns, and make decisions quickly using graphs and charts.

18. **What is Outlier?**
    An outlier is a data point that is very different from other points in the dataset.

19. **When to use histogram and pie chart:**

    * Histogram: For showing distribution of numerical data
    * Pie Chart: For showing proportions/percentages of categories

20. **Challenges in Big Data Visualization:**

    * Handling large volumes of data
    * Real-time data updates
    * Performance and clarity of graphs

21. **What is jointplot and distplot?**

    * `jointplot()`: Shows relationship between 2 variables with scatter and histogram
    * `distplot()`: Shows distribution of a single variable (now replaced by `displot()`)

22. **Tools used for data visualization:**

    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Tableau
    * Power BI
    * Plotly

### üßπ **Data Preprocessing**

23. **What is Data Wrangling?**
    Cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a usable format.

24. **What is Data Transformation?**
    Converting data into another format or structure for analysis (e.g., normalization, scaling).

25. **Use of `StandardScaler()` in Python:**
    It standardizes data by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

### üêò **Big Data & Hadoop**

26. **What is Hadoop?**
    An open-source framework to store and process big data using a distributed computing system.

27. **What is HDFS and MapReduce?**

    * HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System, used to store big data in blocks
    * MapReduce: Programming model for processing large datasets in parallel

28. **Components of Hadoop Ecosystem:**
    HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, Hive, Pig, HBase, Sqoop, Flume, Oozie, Spark, etc.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Scala & Big Data Tools**

29. **What is Scala?**
    Scala is a high-level programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming. Used in Apache Spark.

30. **Features of Scala:**

    * Combines OOP and functional programming
    * Interoperable with Java
    * Concise syntax
    * Immutable collections

31. **How is Scala different from Java?**
